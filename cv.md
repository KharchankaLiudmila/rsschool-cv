## _About Myself_
My profession is a doctor. Having completed many years (7+ years of experience) in my specialist field of neonatology (treatment of newborn children) I have dicided that the time is right for a change in area of activity. Work in medicine was the most exciting and at the time difficult period of my life.
IT for me is self-development, motivation and endless space for imagination.
I am looking to broaden my knowledge of medicine, to which I have devoted my life and I'd like to introduce it in IT. May be I can be useful to peace and humanity.
The work has developted the following qualities of my character: enthusiastic, good communication skills with people from diverse backgrounds, highly organized and ditail-oriented, ability to find innovative solutions, adeager to experience and learn new skills.
